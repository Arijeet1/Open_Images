Computer vision has come a long way from
where we were a few years ago. However, there is a
huge gap between the capabilities of a human and that
of a machine. Even the enormous datasets currently
available the number of categories of objects a
computer can identify still cannot be compared to that
of humans can. Moreover, computer vision maybe
able to identify the objects but it has a long way to go
in recognizing the various relationships involved
between the various objects.
